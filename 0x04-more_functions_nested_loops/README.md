This project was undertaken as part of my **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. Its primary objective was to explore the concept of nested loops within the context of the **C language**.

## Technologies
* The C files were compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`.
* The code adheres to the C90 standard.
* Testing was performed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Files
The project consists of several C programs, each serving a distinct purpose:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-isupper.c` | Checks whether a character is uppercase. |
| `1-isdigit.c` | Determines if a character is a digit (`0` through `9`). |
| `2-mul.c` | Performs multiplication of two integers. |
| `3-print_numbers.c` | Prints numbers from `0` to `9`. |
| `4-print_most_numbers.c` | Prints numbers from `0` to `9`, excluding `2` and `4`. |
| `5-more_numbers.c` | Prints numbers from `0` to `14` ten times. |
| `6-print_line.c` | Draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| `7-print_diagonal.c` | Draws a diagonal line in the terminal. |
| `8-print_square.c` | Prints a square pattern. |
| `9-fizz_buzz.c` | Implements the Fizz-Buzz test. |
| `10-print_triangle.c` | Prints a triangular pattern. |
| `100-prime_factor.c` | Finds and displays the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`. |
| `101-print_number.c` | Prints an integer value. |
